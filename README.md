# Skin Cancer Image Classification

This project is an image classification model for distinguishing between benign and malignant skin lesions. The model is built using the VGG16 convolutional neural network architecture and trained on the ISIC (International Skin Imaging Collaboration) dataset.

## Introduction
Skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer, with early detection being crucial for successful treatment. This project aims to develop an image classification model that can help medical professionals and patients identify potential skin cancer lesions.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the ISIC (International Skin Imaging Collaboration) dataset, which contains images of benign and malignant skin lesions. The dataset is divided into two folders: `ISIC-images-benign` and `ISIC-images-malignant`.

## Model Architecture
The model used in this project is based on the VGG16 convolutional neural network architecture. The model consists of the following layers:

1. VGG16 base model (with pre-trained ImageNet weights, and the top layers frozen)
2. Flatten layer
3. Dense layer with 128 units and ReLU activation
4. Dropout layer with a rate of 0.5
5. Dense layer with 64 units and ReLU activation
6. Dense layer with 1 unit and sigmoid activation (for binary classification)

## Training
The model is trained using the following techniques:

- Image data augmentation (rotation, shifting, shearing, zooming, horizontal flipping)
- Early stopping to prevent overfitting
- Learning rate reduction on plateau to improve convergence

The training is performed for 20 epochs with a batch size of 32.

## Evaluation
The model is evaluated on a held-out test set, and the following metrics are reported:

- Test accuracy
- Test loss
- Classification report (precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class)

## Usage
To use the model, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that all the required dependencies are installed (see the [Dependencies](#dependencies) section).
2. Modify the `DRIVE_BASE`, `DATA_PATH`, and `MODEL_PATH` variables to match your file structure.
3. Run the `main()` function to train the model, evaluate it, and save the model files.
